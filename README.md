# Data-Analysis

HiðŸ˜Š , <br/>
I have did an analysis on the Covid-19 Cases in India  <br/>
The dataset I have taken is covid_19_india.csv <br/>
The dataset contains the foollowing columns:- <br/>
-	Sno
-	Date	
-	Time	
-	State/UnionTerritory	
-	ConfirmedIndianNational	
-	ConfirmedForeignNational	
-	Cured	
-	Deaths	
-	Confirmed <br/>
<br/>
I have used different plots like the scatter plot to analyse the dataset.

It was found that there existed a linear relation ship between confirmed and Cured. 
But it was also noted that the rate of growth was slow between the graph plotted between the confirmed and death.<br/>


Thank you for reading !
